    <h3> Manal Echbiki</h3>
    <p>Hello I'm Manal Echbiki and I had little experience in coding prior to this course. I started my course at City University of London in 2021 and I've been learning different modules which are allowing me to further my knowledge and interest in different components of computer science. I have  an interest in music and films, I also often read.</p>

    <h3>Java project: 2D Zombie game</h3>
    <p>My java project is 2D platform halloween themed game which includes zombies,soldiers and vaccines, it also has three levels which each increased in difficulty. It was a great opportunity to showcase what I've learned since the beginning of the programming in java module. It allowed me to learn about many different and interesting topics, such as GUIs, object oriented pogramming, how to effectively work with files and essentially build a 2D game. I've been able to experiment with different ideas for this game since I was able to come up with an idea without much restrictions from the requirements. My main challenge was making sure that when my character proceeded to the next level it was still able to shoot, move,interact with the other bodies in each level aswell as having the number of vaccines collected and lives avialable changing throughout the whole game. I also had to make sure that each level was different with distinct bodies as well as make sure that the background music was changing seemlessly when moving from one level to the other.
